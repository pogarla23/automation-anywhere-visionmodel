## Problem Statement

The goal of this initiative is to train an advanced object detection model on a curated dataset of business documents and application screenshots. This model aims to localize signatures within these documents efficiently.

## Importance of the Project

Signature detection automation reduces the manual effort required in document processing, minimizes errors, and accelerates the workflow, making it invaluable in finance, healthcare, and legal sectors.

## Data Understanding

We utilized signature images documented in JPG format. The annotations, including bounding box coordinates, are meticulously formatted in CSV files to align with our model's input requirements.



## Methodology

Our approach adheres to the CRISP-DM Framework, ensuring a structured and efficient model development process:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the scope and objectives of the project.
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze the data to ascertain its suitability for the problem.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleanse, preprocess, and ready the data for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Select and train the machine learning models.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the model using appropriate metrics.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model into a production environment.

## Models Detailed Overview
